# SiCADA

**SiCADA** is a C# communication library for PLCs that combines:

- **Symbolic addressing** in code (e.g., `MyPlc.MyDB.MyVar.CV`)
- **Strong typing** for compile-time validation and IntelliSense support
- **Absolute memory addressing** over the wire for increased performance

---

## Supported PLCs and IDEs

The following PLC models and development environments are supported by SiCADA and are expected to work based on architecture and compatibility:

- **PLCs:**
  - Siemens S7-200 series
  - Siemens S7-300 series
  - Siemens S7-400 series
  - Siemens S7-1200 series
  - Siemens S7-1500 series

- **IDEs:**
  - Siemens TIA Portal v15.0 to v20.0

---

## Fully Tested Configurations

The following hardware and software configurations have been thoroughly tested and verified to work reliably:

- **PLCs:**
  - Siemens S7-1517-3 PN/DP

- **IDEs:**
  - Siemens TIA Portal v15.1
